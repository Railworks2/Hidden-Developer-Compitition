								<h3>Is there a computer powerful enough to run it?</h3>
							</header>
							<p>Well, a computer would have to simulate the power of every single person on Earth for it to work, this would require  million, trillion, trillion, trillion operations per second to run. But that isn't possible, as we know.</p>

								<h3>What if super advanced civilizations want to run simulations?</h3>
							</header>
							<p>To us, those civilizations are like Gods. For example, if we was a bug in a theme-park, the Gods would be the humans, the bug doesn't understand it. What's fun? What's a themepark? What's a holiday? Advanced civilizations might run simulations for fun or maybe as a form of science.</p>

								<h3>What is there are thousands of simulations?</h3>
							</header>
							<p>If there are thosands of simulations, it's very highly likely that you are in one. Maybe it's all just a video game to them, like the Sims are to us, simulating billions of conscious beings.</p>
