```[SATURDAY COMPETITIONS]:
It's been a long time since we've had any competition. A long, long time (maybe a few weeks). Therefore, we need to redeem ourselves. What better way to start off than with a random, out of the blue Website Competition! If anyone out of @everyone is a website developer (including those without the roles) wants to compete in said competition, be ready to fight to the... win? by making a web-page according to the theme revealed tomorrow at the beginning of the competition.

Looking at the poll, many people wanted the competition pushed up 2-4 hours, so we will settle at 3:00PM EST for tomorrow's competition.

Edit: You can compete in groups, so I suggest making a group now for tomorrow.(edited)
[15:47] nforeman: [WEBSITE COMPETITION RULES]:
@Off-site Devs I'm just going to mention y'all because I feel like y'all will be more likely to attend.

The competition hasn't started yet (we still have a few hours), but I will set some "ground rules".
1) Don't copy other people's work and claim it as yours. This is self-explainatory. Just don't do it.
2) The website must be ONE PAGE. This means you aren't making a whole elaborate website, just a page that looks best and fits the theme.
3) The website size must be no larger than 400MB (reason explained below)

If there are more rules needed, they will be added.

The reason for the 400MB file size is because I've decided that instead of hosting the website on github, the website will just be sent to me and I will make a website containing all the "subsites" (links to all the actual site uploaded to my directory).
Basically, I will host the sites you made so that people can vote for them. :wink:
[19:49] nforeman: @everyone This is the last reminder. The website competition starts in 15 minutes. If you plan to attend, join the Events voice channel.
Teams are allowed.

If you plan to attend, please read the following rules.

3) The website must not use MySQL, Redis, or any other database software.
4) The website must not be copied from somewhere else or using any type of open source code.
5) Searching up API or how to do something is obviously okay as long as you do not copy it.
6) You may use free assets but they must comply with Digital Millennium Copyright Act,  Electronic Communications Privacy Act, Patriot Act, FISA Amendments Act, and Communications Decency Act.
7) The website must not use cookies.
